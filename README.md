# Catalyst.XNA.Engine
#### Microsoft XNA Graphics Engine and Tool Chain

This was a port from Microsoft Managed DirectX Graphics Engine back in 2009 to Microsoft XNA.

It was later also ported to Monogame which I will soon upload to GitHub as well.

Many 2D games were created using this engine and tool chain and some released on Windows Phone.
